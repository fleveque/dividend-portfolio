<%#
  React SPA Page
  ==============
  This view is intentionally empty because React handles all rendering.

  The layout (layouts/react.html.erb) provides:
  - The <div id="react-root"> where React mounts
  - The vite_javascript_tag that loads our React code

  React Router handles navigation between:
  - / (HomePage)
  - /login (LoginPage)
  - /radar (RadarPage - protected)

  All routes serve this same page; React Router reads the URL
  and renders the appropriate component.
