  React Test Page
  ===============
  This view is intentionally empty because React handles all rendering.

  The layout (layouts/react.html.erb) provides:
  - The <div id="react-root"> where React mounts
  - The vite_javascript_tag that loads our React code

  When you visit this page:
  1. Rails renders this (empty) template inside the layout
  2. The browser loads the JavaScript from Vite
  3. React finds <div id="react-root"> and takes over
  4. StockCard component renders inside the div

  In later phases, we'll have React Router handle multiple "pages"
  within this single mount point.
